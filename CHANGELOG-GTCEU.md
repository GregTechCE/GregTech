- EBF coils have new textures, and have connected textures
- Fusion and Superconductor coils for EBF replaced with Diamericium Titanium and Fluxed Electrum (tentative replacements)
- Tanks in Machines now display their total fluid amount without needing the tooltip

- Shadows of Greg Bundler recipes added to Packer and Unpacker
- New tiers of Cells to hold much larger quantities of fluids
- EBF now has coil bonuses:
    - Every 900K above the recipe temperature applies a multiplicative 5% energy discount
    - Every 1800K above the recipe temperature applies a "perfect overclock" (/4 duration instead of /2)
    - Every voltage tier above MV increases the total temperature by 100K
- Transformers now have the "lower voltage side" on 5 sides, with higher voltage on one side
- Infinite Energy Emitter for debug and Creative (or expert-pack endgame)

    - Default logic is a flat /2 (from 2/2.8 split previously)
    - Config option is available, allowing a range from 2.0 to 3.0
    - ULV -> LV no longer overclocks, keeping ULV recipes much more energy efficient
- Primitive Water Pump was added (credit IMPACT)
    - Craftable before Steam-Era, requiring only Iron, Wood, and Stone
    - Outputs up to 3B/s of water, or as low as 150mB depending on the Hatch used and the Biome it is placed in
    - Look at JEI Info Tab for more details
- Steam Machines now have a more distinct texture on their Venting Output
- Drums and Tanks can now be cleared via a crafting recipe (like EIO Tanks), similar to Quantum/Super Tanks
- Some Steam-Era Multiblock Machines were added:
    - Steam Grinder:
        - Multiblock Macerator at Steam-Age
        - Consumes 2x the base rate of Steam, at 1.5x the base duration, but up to 8 items at a time
    - Steam Oven:
        - Multiblock Furnace at Steam-Age
        - Consumes 2x the base rate of Steam, at 1.5x the base duration, but up to 8 items at a time
- Tools can now be enchanted with Efficiency and Unbreaking
- Item Pipes have been added
    - Much larger throughput compared to options from other Mods
    - More efficient (TPS) than EnderIO Conduits
    - Two Modes with a Conveyor or Robot Arm cover:
        - "Priority":
            - Each Pipe has a "priority" value
            - Items will go to the lowest priority value first
            - Restrictive Pipes can be used to drastically reduce priority
        - Round Robin
            - Items will be evenly distributed to each destination
            - Unlike EnderIO, a single "group" of items extracted will be split across destinations
            - If an uneven amount of items to destinations, priority will break the tie
- Many more materials now have Fluid Pipes and Item Pipes
- Multiblocks can now share ALL hatches (energy, item in/out, fluid in/out) excluding Rotor Holders
- Mixer now has 2 more Item Input slots
- Chemical Reactor now has 1 more Item Output Slot
- GT Wrenches will now work for: BuildCraft, EnderIO, Thermal Expansion, Applied Energistics

    - Computer Monitor: a decorative cover
    - Energy Detector Cover: outputs redstone signal based on energy stored (has a few modes)
    - Fluid Detector Cover: outputs redstone signal based on fluid stored (has a few modes)
    - Item Detector Cover: outputs redstone signal based on items stored (has a few modes)
    - Crafting Station Cover: a GT Crafting Station, as a Cover!
    - Infinite Water Cover: creates 16 Buckets of water every second
- Air Collectors reworked to Gas Collectors:
    - Have different Gases in each dimension
    - Use a Programmed Circuit, so can collect different gases in each dimension
    - Can be added to by CraftTweaker
- Steam Era reworked:
    - Steam Machines:
        - Bronze Steam Machines now have double the duration of LV/Steel Steam Machines
        - Steel Steam Machines have normal LV duration but 2x the Steam Consumption
        - In total, Bronze/Steel/LV machines all have equivalent Steam Consumption (if using Steam Turbine for LV)
        - Many early game recipes tweaked to make the Bronze Machine nerf not as bad
        - Steel Steam Machine recipes are much more reasonable, requiring at most 1 Steel per machine, and being "direct upgrade" recipes for Bronze Machines
    - Steam Boilers:
        - Added Steel Solar Boiler
        - Boilers have a more clear steam production, now per second instead of 25/10 ticks
        - Lava generators buffed by 3x
        - Bronze Solar Steam Boiler buffed by 2x
- Many JEI pages reworked (distillation tower, coke oven, assembly line) to be fancier
- Cable Loss reworked:
    - Lossless wires will now no longer damage you
    - Cables will always have lossy wires, unless they are "Superconductors"
    - Superconductors are available at every tier, and are only wires to reduce clutter
- High-Amp Energy Hatches added (can be configured with a Screwdriver, with amperages: 2, 4, 8, 16)

- GT Cables and wires can now natively power RF-consuming machines (with config, default true)
- Simple Ore Washer added
    - Ore Washer, but only at LV
    - Consumes 100mB of Water per recipe
    - Is much faster than an Ore Washer, but grants no byproducts
    - Can do: crushed -> crushedPurified, impureDust -> dust, pureDust -> dust
    - Effectively an Electric Cauldron
- Fluid Pipe Algorithm fully reworked:
    - Pipes will behave similar to GT5, but without sloshing
    - Fluids will be evenly split across all directions at a pipe "junction"
    - Can also be set to Round Robin (with Pump cover)
- Added Quadruple (4) and Nonuple (9) Pipes, which can move multiple fluid types through them at once
- Distillation Tower Fluid Input Hatch can be placed on any block on the bottom layer. Energy Input Hatch can be placed on any block in the structure

### Major Recipe Changes

- Ores that can be "directly smelted" into their materials have been reworked, so that dusts, crushed ore, etc will also direct smelt to the material
- Decomposition Recipes (electrolysis, centrifuging) will now divide down to as few inputs as possible, still retaining full dusts and full buckets of outputs
- Double Plates and Rounds were added, used in specific recipes
- Many, many, many progression-related recipes were fixed (mostly from SoG) to allow full progression in the base mod
- EBF coils now have slightly more complex recipes (configurable, default true)
- Coal Gas and Coal Tar were added as another optional but very beneficial source of resources
- Singleblock Distilleries will now always output the Item in the Distillation Recipe
- Alloys can no longer be handcrafted past Stainless Steel, and require an on-tier Mixer to make
- Harder recipes for Energy Hatches (configurable, default false)
- Config to disable in-world Concrete Powder -> Concrete conversion

### Bug Fixes
- Electric Tools now properly use power over durability
